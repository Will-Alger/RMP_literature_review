\subsection{Overview of Ratemyprofessor.com}
Rate my professor is a website that has been around since 1999. For the longest time,
it has been the leading public platform for students to anonymously leave reviews about 
their college professors. Many competitors have come and gone while Ratemyprofessor.com
has stood the test of time. Despite it's popularity, professors, researchers, and students
alike have often debated on its true value. This is in part due to the fact that the site 
does not require a reviewer to verify that they took the class, nor that they are even a 
college student. Despite its limitations, the vast amount of publicly available data - 
with a little over two million professor profiles - has drawn interest among researchers seeking to
understand student perceptions in academia. This contrasts with formal university evaluations, which are
frequently diffucult to obtain and inaccessible for research purposes.
