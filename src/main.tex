\section{Abstract}
\begin{abstract}
-This literature review explores the multifaceted role of RateMyProfessor.com in shaping the perceptions and actions of students and teachers in higher education. 
The objective of this review is to gain a deeper understanding of the platform, evaluate its tangible impacts on students and teachers, and potentially identify strategies for improving its effectiveness as an educational tool. Findings reveal that RateMyProfessor's widespread usage amongst students plays a moderate role in shaping perceptions, academic decision-making, and course selection. One study highlights how online reviews present on RateMyProfessor are capable of shaping students' self-efficacy, perceived control, anticipated grades, and expectations of the course environment, often setting a precedent before even stepping foot in the classroom. Furthermore, teachers with positive reviews have the potential to heighten students' expectations of success, resulting in increased engagement and classroom performance. On the contrary, exposure to negative reviews may dampen these expectations and lead to poorer performance and engagement. To one extreme, an article revealed that even a single negative comment has the potential to shift students' perceptions despite an overall positive rating held by a professor. This impact extends to professors as well; despite a significant preference for formal university evaluations, professors are equally influenced by their RateMyProfessor ratings. Reviews on RateMyProfessor have the ability to alter a teachers sense of professional competence and teaching methodologies. Long term effects could be detrimental to pedagogical choices. The dual effect on teachers and students underscores the need for a balanced approach to student feedback systems. In light of the sources reviewed, this paper suggests enhancements to RateMyProfessor, primarily focusing on refining its feedback mechanism. As we conclude, we emphasize the continued need for additional research into the role these platforms play in educational quality.

% Review Objectives
This literature review seeks to explore the consequential impacts of RateMyProfessor.com within higher education, focusing particularly on the behaviors, actions, and perceptions of students and educators. We will explore the existing literature on how the platform influences student and teachers decisions and outcomes in and out of the classroom and learning environment. We will also aim to identify potential strategies to enhance its effectiveness as an educational tool. Lastly, we aim to highlight areas where further research is necessary. 

% Thesis Statement or Hypothesis
Guiding our analysis is the assumption that RateMyProfessor, due to its extensive reach and influence within higher education, impacts both students and educators in a multitued of ways. This review aims to uncover specific areas of the platform that, if enhanced, could lead to better outcomes and impacts for both students and educators.

\section{Overview of RateMyProfessor.com}
% Brief History
RateMyProfessor is a website that has been around since 1999. It has long been the leading public platform for students to anonymously leave reviews about their college professors. Many competitors have come and gone, yet RateMyProfessor has stood the test of time. 
% Platform Features
RateMyProfessor enables any registered user to submit reviews for professors or schools. Users can share comments and rate various aspects, including the difficulty level of a professor's course and their overall teaching quality. Similarly, users can evaluate specific facets of schools, such as social life and academic opportunities. Each metric rated on a 5-point scale.

%  User Base
While educators might use RateMyProfessor to gain insights into their teaching practice, the platform is predominantly catered towards students. According to the website's guidelines, their mission is clearly stated as: "providing a safe forum to share classroom experiences to help fellow students make critical education choices." This observation is further supported by the general layout of the platform, which more closely mirrors a product review page than a pedagogical tool for educators to enhance their teaching methods and student engagement strategies.

%  Criticisms and Controversies
Despite RateMyProfessors' continued popularity, its ability to be an effective measure of teacher effectiveness has long been contested by researchers \textcite{rosen_correlations_2018}. This skepticism could stem from the platform's lack of mechanisms for verifying student class enrollment, time the class was taken, or even university affiliation. Moreover, the anonymous nature of the platform's online reporting system leaves it suspetible to a wide range of biases.

%  Research interest and Data availability
Regardless of the limitations of RateMyProfessor, its vast amount of publicly availabile data -- encompassing over two million professor profiles, nearly 8000 schools, and tens of millions of reviews -- has long-drawn the attention of researchers seeking to understand student perceptions in academia. This stands in contrast to formal university evaluations, which, due to privacy and institutional guidelines, are often challenging to acquire or inaccessible for research purposes.The considerable scale of RateMyProfessor, coupled with its long-standing presence in the academic landscape, makes the platform a particularly worthwhile subject for exploration. Thoroughly understanding the nature of its influence is crucial for gaining insights into how we can develop a more effective and beneficial tool for both students and teachers in higher education.

\section{Review of Literature}
In the following section, our review of literature will explore the array of research that has been conducted around RateMyProfessor. Our objective is to uncover recurring themes and significant findings from these studies over the years. We aim to explore several facets of this topic in our review: the platform’s influence on educators and their pedagogical methods, its sway over students' course and instructor selections, and the subtle ways it impacts both student and educator self-efficacy.

Setting the scope of our analysis, this review intentionally omits an exploration of literature around the platform's review validity, ability to measure teaching effectiveness, or potential biases inherent in its reviews (see for example, \textcite{reid_role_2010,hartman_what_2013, azab_analysing_2016, boring_gender_2017, rosen_correlations_2018, baker_quantcrit_2019, gordon_role_2021}). Experts opinions about RateMyProfessor’s accuracy in assessing teaching effectiveness vary widely. While considering this perspective is useful for gaining a deeper understanding about student perceptions and biases in University, this discussion does not contribute to the goal of this review.  Numerous studies emphasize that despite differing views on review credibility or potential bias, the platform's effects are significant, measurable, and have instigated shifts in decision-making patterns amongst students and educators alike \textcite{johnson_i_2014, boswell_ratemyprofessors_2016, boswell_effects_2020}. By acknowledging the limitations and methodologies of the studies reviewed, we aim to highlight gaps in the existing literature and outline potential avenues for future research.

\section{Student Engagement with RateMyProfessor}
Numerous studies have consistently highlighted the widespread usage of RateMyProfessor amongst students. A 2009 study by \textcite{davison_how_2009} surveyed 216 students, revealing that 92\% were aware of RateMyProfessor, 80\% had visited the site more than once, and a notable 95\% deemed it a credible source of information. Further supporting these findings, \textcite{bleske-rechek_ratemyprofessors_2010} showed that amongst their survey of 208 respondents, 84\% of students had visited the site and 23\% had posted a review. More recently, a study conducted by \textcite{chiang_students_2017} with 166 students from a marketing class demonstrated the continued usage of RateMyProfessor: 84.4\% of these students had visited the site within the past two years, and nearly a quarter (24.6\%) had actively participated by posting ratings. It is clear from these samples that RateMyProfessor has not only drawn the interest of students, but continued to maintain its popularity throughout the years since its launch.

\section{RateMyProfessor as a Decision-making Tool}
The high prevalence of RateMyProfessor usage has encouraged researchers to investigate how this platform impacts academic decisions, notably course selection. Building upon this idea, a study by \textcite{johnson_i_2014} demonstrated a positive correlation between professor ratings and course enrollment. This base is further strengthened by research from \textcite{orlova_ratemyprofessorscom_2021}, which found in a sample of 51 participants that student preferences for specific classes are subject to change based on either positive or negative RateMyProfessor evaluations. Similarly, evidence from a survey involving 73 participants, as indicated by \textcite{boswell_effects_2020}, reveals that students' enrollment decisions can be significantly influenced by exposure to university SETs (Student Evaluations of Teaching) or RateMyProfessor evaluations equally. These studies highlight two significant aspects of RateMyProfessor's impact: firstly, its power to shape student class preferences, and secondly, its influence on course enrollment numbers. Although the sample sizes for these studies are relatively small, they provide moderate evidance that RateMyProfessor plays a role as a course selection tool for students.

\section{Effect of RateMyProfessor on Student Self-efficacy and Perceptions}
The influence of professor ratings on students has the potential to shape their classroom experience before it has even started. Not only do these ratings guide course selection, but they also mold students' expectations about their potential success within a class. For instance, \textcite{boswell_effects_2020} found that evaluations, be they positive or negative, have a profound impact on students' self-efficacy. This in turn affects their confidence in grasping the course material and meeting expected learning outcomes. A similar sentiment is echoed by \textcite{kowai-bell_rate_2011}, who demonstrated that evaluations from RateMyProfessor notably influence students' perceived control, grade expectations, and overall attitude toward the class.

Revealing the importance of these ratings further, \textcite{scherr_single_2013} emphasized how even a solitary negative comment on RateMyProfessor can dramatically alter students' perception of the course environment, even if other ratings are predominantly positive. This demonstrates the potent power of online reviews in shaping student perspectives, which can then ripple into their academic performance, course choices, and overall contentment with their education.

Building on this, \textcite{reber_perceptual_2017} discovered that students exposed to positive evaluations not only reported higher engagement in their classes but also better performance as compared to their counterparts who encountered negative reviews. This suggests a self-fulfilling prophecy at play: students who encounter positive evaluations develop a heightened sense of confidence and engagement, leading to superior academic outcomes.

\section{Effect of RateMyProfessor on Professors}
The impact of RateMyProfessor is not confined to students alone; it also presents implications for teachers. Even though professors often view university SETs as a more accurate form of evaluation compared to RateMyProfessor evaluations, they are still significantly influenced by the latter, despite perceiving it as less accurate \textcite{boswell_ratemyprofessors_2016}. \textcite{boswell_ratemyprofessors_2016} further found that teachers' awareness and perception of their online ratings influenced their sense of professional competence and effectiveness in the classroom. Negative reviews, in particular, were associated with decreased teacher self-efficacy, which could alter teaching practices and pedagogical choices over time. Notably, the literature on this topic is sparse, with the discussion here primarily based on the findings from the study by \textcite{boswell_ratemyprofessors_2016}. Further research is warrented to expand our understanding on the impact of RateMyProfessor.com on professors and educators.

\section{Discussion}

This literature review illustrates how RateMyProfessor is not only widely used by students but also influences their course selections and perceptions of courses and instructors. We discuss a few of the primary effects oberserved from the website, with a detailed focus on 
platform engagement, self-efficacy, and decision-making. Existing reserach provides adequte evideance to support these impacts both in and out of the classroom. Together, these impacts manifest in the way students approach their academic journey, potentially guiding their educational experience from information gathered on the platform. 

\subsection*{Impacts on Students}
\textcite{scherr_single_2013} reveals the ability of a single negative comment to shift student perception despite an overall positive rating, demonstrating the potency and weight of the platform in academia.




% As previously highlighted by \textcite{scherr_single_2013}, the ability of a single negative evaluation to shift student perception demonstrates the weight of the platform.


% While the focus has predominantly been on students,  professors are notably affected by RateMyProfessor reviews as demonstrated in \textcite{boswell_ratemyprofessors_2016}. The lack in existing literature about the impacts of the platform on professors highlights the need for further exploration on the topic. The existing evidence suggests that professors, while an afterthought in terms of the platforms intended audience, are indeed influenced by their online reviews. This conclusion paves the way for the need to introduce more tools for educators on RateMyProfessor, aiming to provide them with constructive feedback and insights into their teaching methodologies.

% Impact on student decision making
% The reviewed literature clearly pointed to results showing that not only is RateMyProfessor widely used by students, but it also has the potential to influence course selections and perceptions about courses and instructors. This has implications for Professors as well. While \textcite{boswell_ratemyprofessors_2016} explores the potential self-efficacy effects on professors that perceive their RateMyProfessor evaluations, there exists a gap in literature around the impacts of RateMyProfessor on professors and how it influences pedagogical choices over time. 

% Coupled together, these two points highlight how Professors have been the afterthought in terms of existing literature, and the platforms intended audience.

% Given that RateMyProfessor appears to be here to stay for the time being, and that professors can also be influenced by their online reviews, it seems like a good idea for more tools for educators to be implemented on this platform.

% Another particularly underexplored area of RateMyProfessor is in terms of reviews over time. Since the platform has been around for over two decades, it seems warranted for further research into how reviews have possibly changed over time. This could be helpful for professors to see as well, such as some graphs that allow professors to see the history of the score on the platform, and how their reviews have trended over time.

% This could further be helpful to students as well. Given that students can be heavily influenced by even a single negative comment as discussed in \textcite{scherr_single_2013}, providing more depth to what makes up a professors online evaluations may allow students to make more educated course selections. Currently, there exists no features to see how professors compare to their peers within their respective department. 

% It could be, for example, that professors in upper level mathematics  are rated lower overall due to course difficulty. Providing context to a professors online evaluations, such as how their stack against their peers, might allow students a better perspective into the learning environment.
